# DankPod
An iPod classic emulator written in Swift - made for fun, work in progress!

Project is NOT finished:
*Photos section not implemented
*Videos section not implemented
*Extras section not implemented
*Settings section not implemented
*Half way through implementing a queuing system using force touch but not complete
  
If you do anything cool with this project I'd love to see it!
